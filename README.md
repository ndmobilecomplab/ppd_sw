This is the software and other necessities for the Predator Protection Device (PPD) currently in development at the University of Notre Dame.

The flashlight_patterns directory contains LED light patterns that are supposed to resemble a searching flashlight. The sound_files directory contains our current collection of sounds. The sd directory contains all of the files that will be preloaded on each PPD.
